            <h3> positioning an element </h3>
            <p> Many element, including "div" can be put at specified position by: 
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        Using <strong> position:absolute; top:XXpx; left:YYpx </strong>
                        to specify top left corner of element relative to the page.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Using <strong> position:relative; top:XXpx; left:YYpx </strong>
                        to specify top left corner of element relative to where it would
                        normaly appear.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <div style="background:pink; fort-size:14pt; font-family: courier;
                        position:relative; top: 170px; left: -20px"> 
                This div will be position lower than it should and pushed too much to the right
                This is why it appears lower than the next section "span" in the webpage.
            </div>
        
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h3> Span </h3>
            
            <p> 
                just like div, span is an element, doesn't have default style
                but it's used for only a few words.
            </p>
            
            <p> This paragraph contains only a <span> few words </span></p>

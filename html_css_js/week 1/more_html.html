            <h3> Breaks </h3>
            <p> There are 3 types of break:
                <ul>
                    <li> the "br" -- forced break, start a new line regardless of situation </li>
                    <li> the "wbr" -- optional break, start a new line when there's not enough space, maybe for a long words </li>
                    <li> the hr -- makes a line a.k.a. horizontal rules </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p> demo: </p>
